&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This project was made in order implement 3d shading algorithms. Using custom vertex and fragment shaders ambient, diffuse and specular lighting are calculated for two different shading algorithms. Gourand and Phong shading are avaliable for each scene and give different resolution views as the final color of each model are calculated per vertex for Gourand and per pixel for Phong. Lights can be moved around to show different lighting conditions in the scenes. Custom models are made of vertex and texture data to create a sea scene, a space scene and a house scene. The ground texture uses bump mapping, where textures are turned to x/y elevations to create custom terrain for different scenes.

Controls: </br>
- Click and drag the mouse to move around the entire scene</br>
- Left and right arrow keys move the camera left and right </br>
- WASD moves lights around in the system </br>
- Dropdown menus change scene, shading algorithm, the light under control, and bump-mapping scale that changes ground elevation </br> </br>

This work is based on sample code made by tmarrian. This is also a group project with collaborator mmoeller15.
